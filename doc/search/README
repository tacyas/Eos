	The simple search script was written to allow people to set up a 
search of their site, so their users could enter keywords and find all 
documents matching those keywords.  It was written to be simple, so there 
are not many options.  When the search returns pages, it returns them in 
no real order, and they are referenced with the <title> tag of that page.

	The instructions below explain how to set up and configure the 
Simple Search script.  The script should have come with three files:

	1) README 	- Useful installation instructions.
	2) search.pl 	- The Perl script which does the searching.
	3) search.html  - A sample HTML Search Page.

SEARCH.PL
=========

	This script is the one that you will need to define what files 
you want to be searched and the locations of those files.  First you need 
to define the variables:

	$basedir = '';
		This is the base directory to the files you will want to 
	   search.  If you have all of your files in /home/joe/public_html
	   and you want to search files that are in 
	   /home/joe/public_html/work and /home/joe/public_html/fun, then
	   you would set your base directory at /home/joe/public_html/ and
	   then put subdirectories into the @files array, since they will be 
	   put together at run time.  The $basedir variable just saves you the 
	   time of having to type out the basedir over and over again for 
	   every file you want to include.

	$baseurl = '';
		This is very similar to the basedir variable except that 
	   it will be used as a base reference to the files you want to search
	   in terms of the web.  For the example above with user joe, his 
	   baseurl would probably be something like: http://joe.host.com/~joe/ 
	   so that when the searched files are appended to this baseurl, they 
	   form a complete url to his files to place in the results.

	@files = ();
		This is an array that includes all of the files you want 
	   to search.  The directory paths and filenames should be in 
	   reference to $basedir.  Wild cards are allowed in this array, so if 
	   joe wanted to search all html files in fun/ and work/, he would set 
	   his @files array up as: @files = ('fun/*.html','work/*.html');  You 
	   can also search whole directories at one time, like: @files = 
	   ('fun/','work/');  This would search all text files located in these 
	   directories.  Putting exact filenames will search only that filename.

	$title = "";
		This variable is used to display the title of your page 
	   in the search results and used to link back to your main page.

	$title_url = '';
		This is the url that would link to the page $title.

	$search_url = '';
		This is the url to the search.html page you set up, so 
	   that it can be referenced from in the results page if users want
	   to make another search.

    That is all of the variables that need to be configured in your 
script.  You must also chmod this script to 755 so that all users can 
execute it and place it in your cgi-bin or change the name to 
search.cgi.  Now you simply have to edit the search.html page and you are 
ready to go!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEARCH.HTML
===========

	This page needs only a little changing.  You will probably want 
to change the title and header of this page to match your site, and you 
may want to change the background and other features of it to make it fit 
into your site better.

	The main thing you will need to change is the action="" of your 
script from the fake url, to the url of your search.pl script.  Once you 
have changed this, and have implemented the changes listed above in 
search.pl, the search program should work.

	search.html should be chmoded 744 so that it is readable by everyone.
