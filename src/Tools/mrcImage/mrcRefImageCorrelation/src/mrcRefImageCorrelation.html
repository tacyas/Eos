    [-I[nput array of file]InArray             (stdin     ).as(inFileList          ) ] :Optional  :InputDataFiles
    [-z[position]        z                   (0         ).as(Integer             ) ] :Optional  :z position of reference file to correlate.For mode 1 only
----- Additional Usage -----
mode 0: To find the images in the reference file of min and max correlation.  Correlation is calclated in the real space.
mode 1: To calculate the correlation between one image of the reference file and input file.  The calculation is performed in the fourier space and the output is a mrc image file.  option z is needed.
