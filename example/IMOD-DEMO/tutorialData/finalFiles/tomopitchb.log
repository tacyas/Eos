 MODEL FILES OR TIMES MUST OCCUR IN ORDER OF DECREASING SAMPLE COORDINATE



 Analysis of positions from time index  1:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   18.6; thickness of  95.9, set to   96
 slope =  0.0014: to make level, add   0.1 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   18.3; thickness of  95.9, set to   96


 Analysis of positions from time index  2:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   19.0; thickness of  94.0, set to   96
 slope = -0.0009: to make level, add  -0.1 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   19.2; thickness of  94.0, set to   96


 Analysis of positions from time index  3:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   18.7; thickness of  94.5, set to   96
 slope =  0.0003: to make level, add   0.0 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   18.6; thickness of  94.5, set to   96


 Analysis of positions from all time indexes:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   18.6; thickness of  95.9, set to   96
 slope =  0.0002: to make level, add   0.0 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   18.5; thickness of  95.9, set to   96

 Pitch between samples can be corrected with an added X-axis tilt of   0.06
 In this case, to make level, add   0.0 to total angle offset
 x-tilted  lines imply added Z shift of   18.7; thickness of  95.9, set to   96

 X axis tilt -  Original:    0.00   Added:    0.06   Total:    0.06
 Angle offset - Original:   -2.12   Added:    0.01   Total:   -2.11
 Z shift -      Original:     0.0   Added:    18.7   Total:    18.7
