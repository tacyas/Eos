 SURFACE ANALYSIS:

 The following parameters are appropriate if fiducials are all on one surface

 Fit of one plane to all fiducials:
 Adjusted slope = -0.0672
 Incremental tilt angle change =   3.84
 Total tilt angle change =         1.73

 The following parameters are provided to indicate the consistency
 of the fit when fiducials are on two surfaces

 Fit of one plane to points on bottom surface:
 # of points =     14
 Z axis intercept =  -35.42
 Adjusted slope =    0.0098
 Mean residual =      0.437
 X axis tilt needed = -0.43
 Incremental tilt angle change =  -0.56
 Total tilt angle change =        -2.67

 Fit of one plane to points on top surface:
 # of points =     11
 Z axis intercept =   45.35
 Adjusted slope =   -0.0034
 Mean residual =      0.875
 X axis tilt needed =  0.21
 Incremental tilt angle change =   0.20
 Total tilt angle change =        -1.91

 The following parameters combine the last two results and are
 appropriate if fiducials are on two surfaces

 Thickness at Z intercepts =      80.77
 Average adjusted slope =        0.0040
 Average X axis tilt needed =     -0.15
 Incremental tilt angle change =  -0.23
 Total tilt angle change =        -2.34
