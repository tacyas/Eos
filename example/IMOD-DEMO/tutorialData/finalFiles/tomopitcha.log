 MODEL FILES OR TIMES MUST OCCUR IN ORDER OF DECREASING SAMPLE COORDINATE



 Analysis of positions from time index  1:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   -5.3; thickness of  93.6, set to   96
 slope = -0.0119: to make level, add  -0.7 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   -7.5; thickness of  92.4, set to   96


 Analysis of positions from time index  2:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   -2.0; thickness of  90.1, set to   96
 slope = -0.0023: to make level, add  -0.1 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   -1.5; thickness of  90.1, set to   96


 Analysis of positions from time index  3:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of    4.1; thickness of  86.4, set to   88
 slope =  0.0014: to make level, add   0.1 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of    3.8; thickness of  86.4, set to   88


 Analysis of positions from all time indexes:
 unrotated lines imply added Z shift of   -2.4; thickness of  99.4, set to  100
 slope = -0.0044: to make level, add  -0.3 to total angle offset
  rotated  lines imply added Z shift of   -1.8; thickness of 100.3, set to  102

 Pitch between samples can be corrected with an added X-axis tilt of   1.83
 In this case, to make level, add  -0.2 to total angle offset
 x-tilted  lines imply added Z shift of   -0.1; thickness of  92.4, set to   96

 X axis tilt -  Original:    0.00   Added:    1.83   Total:    1.83
 Angle offset - Original:   -0.26   Added:   -0.24   Total:   -0.50
 Z shift -      Original:    17.3   Added:    -0.1   Total:    17.2
