 SURFACE ANALYSIS:

 The following parameters are appropriate if fiducials are all on one surface

 Fit of one plane to all fiducials:
 Adjusted slope =  0.1103
 Incremental tilt angle change =  -6.29
 Total tilt angle change =        -6.79

 The following parameters are provided to indicate the consistency
 of the fit when fiducials are on two surfaces

 Fit of one plane to points on bottom surface:
 # of points =     14
 Z axis intercept =  -35.25
 Adjusted slope =   -0.0006
 Mean residual =      0.396
 X axis tilt needed =  2.46
 Incremental tilt angle change =   0.03
 Total tilt angle change =        -0.47

 Fit of one plane to points on top surface:
 # of points =     11
 Z axis intercept =   45.08
 Adjusted slope =   -0.0128
 Mean residual =      0.954
 X axis tilt needed =  1.57
 Incremental tilt angle change =   0.73
 Total tilt angle change =         0.23

 The following parameters combine the last two results and are
 appropriate if fiducials are on two surfaces

 Thickness at Z intercepts =      80.33
 Average adjusted slope =       -0.0060
 Average X axis tilt needed =      2.07
 Incremental tilt angle change =   0.34
 Total tilt angle change =        -0.16
